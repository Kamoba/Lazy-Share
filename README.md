# Lazy-Share
Web page to Share texts and files

I often want to copy and paste text from one device to another.
Or want to send a photo or document from my mobile phone or pc to another device.

So I made this little script of HTML, PHP and jQuery for the moments when I'm having trouble taking a USB flash drive or other means of sharing but especially when I work with my two computers at the same time.

To use it, just put the "lazy-share" folder containing the files in your server/website and access it from YOURWEBSITE/lazy-share?key=lasy.
