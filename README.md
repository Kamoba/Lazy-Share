I often want to copy and paste text (often confidential) quickly from one device to another.
Or want to send a photo or document from my mobile phone or pc to another device.

So I made this little script of HTML, PHP and jQuery for the moments when I'm lazy taking a USB flash drive or other means of sharing but especially when I work with my two computers at the same time.

To use it, just put the "lazy-share" folder containing the files in your server/website and access it from this address : "YOURWEBSITE/lazy-share?key=lasy" (change the key!).

And add this link to the your Bookmarks toolbar.

if the upload remains blocked on the upload image is that the file size limit is exceeded. The file size limit depends on the limit imposed by your server.
